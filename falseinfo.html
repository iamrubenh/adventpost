							On October 3, 2020 Pope Francis made public his third encyclical "Fratelli Tutti" which means all brothers. One of the major things that the encyclical addressed was false information being placed on the internet:<br><br><i>
							We should also recognize that destructive forms of fanaticism are at times found among religious believers, including Christians; they too “can be caught up in networks of verbal violence through the internet and the various forums of digital communication. Even in Catholic media, limits can be overstepped, defamation and slander can become commonplace, and all ethical standards and respect for the good name of others can be abandoned”.[48]  How can this contribute to the fraternity that our common Father asks of us? - Fratelli Tutti </i><br><br>
							Why condemn and engage in topics that is not theirs to dictate? There is a reason why many countries have a separation of church and state, so the church can't dictate to the state. Why would they try to condemn other religions and individuals as fanaticism? Doesn't that make void their peace message? And at the end you see he speaks of a common father. Which common father is he referring to? Is it the Heavenly Father or the Papal "Holy Father"(himself)? <br><br>
							Jesus says: <br><br><b>
							And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ ; and the time draweth near: go ye not therefore after them. - Luke 21:8 KJV
							</b><br><br>
