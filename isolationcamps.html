							Canada plans to build isolation camps from coast to coast not limited to COVID-19 Patients. <br><br>
							Lawmaker Randy Hiller in Ontario Parliament: “Yesterday I asked this government if the people of Ontario should be prepared for internment camps. In September the Federal Government posted a call for expressions of interest, for contractors to supply, provide and manage quarantine/isolation camps throughout every province and every territory in Canada. These quarantine/isolation camps however are not limited to people with COVID, but provide a wide latitude for many people to be detained. Surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast to coast.” <br><br>
							It seems to be that these camps will be used for a wide range of things and people that are not specifically identified in the documents. <br><br>
							Could these be used as concentration camps for people? <br><br>
							In Revelation we are warned of a day to come when people who do not comply with the government and the law of the land will not be able to provide for their daily needs and instead be sanctioned to imprisonment and even death. <br><br>
							<b>And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. - Rev 13:17<br><br>
							And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. - Rev 13:15</b><br><br>
							The Prophecies portrayed in Daniel and Revelation points to the rise and renewal of the Papal supremacy. Are we not surprised that the doctrines for Rome are slowing finding its way into the New World? Each law and bill passed in Canada, The United States of America and neighboring countries are setting up the foundation for which the Papacy will persecute once again.
