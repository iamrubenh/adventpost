							Sunday the first day of the week, was known to many as the day of the sun.<br><br></b>
							In Roman culture, Sunday was the day of the Sun god. In paganism, the Sun was a source of life, giving warmth and illumination to mankind. It was the center of a popular cult among Romans, who would stand at dawn to catch the first rays of sunshine as they prayed. – <a class="address" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday#Sunday_in_Christianity" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Sunday in Christianity)</a>
							<br><br><b>
							Sunday the first day of the week:
							<br><br></b>
							The name "Sunday", the day of the Sun, is derived from Hellenistic astrology, where the seven planets, known in English as Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury and the Moon, each had an hour of the day assigned to them, and the planet which was regent during the first hour of any day of the week gave its name to that day. During the 1st and 2nd century, the week of seven days was introduced into Rome from Egypt, and the Roman names of the planets were given to each successive day. - <a class="address" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday#Etymology" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Sunday Etymology)</a>
							<br><br><b>
							Seventh day of the week that God sanctified for worship and rest: 
							<br><br></b>
							And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. [3] And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
							Genesis 2:2-3 KJV
							<br><br>
							Here is a verse from the 10 Commandments reminding us which day we must keep holy to further emphasis the day of worship:
							<br><br>
							Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. [9] Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: [10] But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: [11] For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
							Exodus 20:8-11 KJV
							<br><br>
							Above you have a direct description of what the seventh day is: The Sabbath Day 
							<br><br><b>
							In many languages the seventh day is described to be the Sabbath: 
							<br><br></b>
							Jewish: Shabbath<br>
							Spanish: Sábado<br>
							Italian: Sabato<br>
							Portuguese: Sábado<br>
							Russian: Subbota
							<br><br><b>
							So how did Sunday make its way into Christianity then?
							<br><br></b>
							The history of the change from the keeping of the seventh day to the first day of the week was done by Roman Emperor Constantine l:
							<br><br>
							“Sunday was another work day in the Roman Empire. On March 7, 321, however, Roman Emperor Constantine I issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating: 
							<br><br>
							All judges and city people and the craftsmen shall rest upon the venerable day of the sun. Country people, however, may freely attend to the cultivation of the fields, because it frequently happens that no other days are better adapted for planting the grain in the furrows or the vines in trenches. So that the advantage given by heavenly providence may not for the occasion of a short time perish.” – <a class="address" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity#Day_of_rest" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Sabbath in Christianity)</a>
							<br><br>
							Sunday was made the day of rest to suit the agenda of the people of Rome since they were already resting and praying on the first day of the week. 
							<br><br><b>
							Was the change from God? No in fact even the Jews from which Jesus and the Apostles came from still believe and worship on the Biblical Sabbath.
							<br><br></b>
							When does the Sabbath begin and when does it end?<br>
							It begins on Friday evening and ends on Saturday evening.
							<br><br>
							Daily cycle biblical proof:<br>
							Starting from the first day:
							<br><br>
							And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. – Genesis 1:5 KJV
							<br><br>
							And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. – Genesis 1:8 KJV
							<br><br>
							If you read carefully you will understand that a day begins on a evening and ends at evening.
							<br><br><b>
							Now when you read the passages leading up to the seventh day you will understand the time when it begins and ends:
							<br><br></b>
							And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. - Genesis 1:31 KJV
							<br><br>
							Sixth day beginning at evening of the fifth day then:
							<br><br>
							And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. – Genesis 2:2 KJV
							<br><br>
							Seventh day beginning at the evening of the sixth day and ending on its evening. How do we know it ends on its evening? Because the first day begins at evening:
							<br><br>
							And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. – Genesis 1:5 KJV
							<br><br>
							Online Proof:<br>
							We should observe the seventh day of the week (Saturday), from even to even, as the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Evening is at sunset when day ends and another day begins. No other day has ever been sanctified as the day of rest. The Sabbath Day begins at sundown on Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday. – <a class="address" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Sabbath#Seventh-day_Sabbatarians" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Biblical Sabbath)</a>
